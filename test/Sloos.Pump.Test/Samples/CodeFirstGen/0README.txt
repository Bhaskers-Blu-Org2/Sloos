This directory contains files created for testing purposes.
 * .linq - LINQPad scripts used to generate databases.
 * .txt  - concatentation of all files generated by Reverse Engineer Code First
           tool included with the Entity Power Tools for EF v5.0.
 * .ssdl - Output of the WriteStoreSchema() test, which uses the EntityStoreSchemaGenerator
           class to generate the store schema from the database.
 * .csdl - Output of the WriteStoreSchema() test, which uses the EntityModelSchemaGenerator
           class to generate the conceptual schema from the database.

These files close the loop and are used to validate my code.  The EF is used to 
generate a database.  The database is then reverse engineered using the EF 
power tools.  A fingerprint (.txt) of the reverse engineering is stored, and used 
for comparison.

The XML documents are used as input to my code to validate my reverse engineering 
of the code.

The .CSDL and .SSDL files were generated using assemblies installed in the GAC, i.e. 
assemblies that ship with .NET.  These file formats have not changed between EF v5
and v6, so this is still an acceptable solution.  (So says the EF team too - check 
StackOverflow.)  Once they have public APIs, I'll cut over and use though.
